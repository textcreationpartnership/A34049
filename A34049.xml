            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſtile is plain, and moving, the phraſe is that of the moſt genuine Fathers, and the whole Compoſition moſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and proper to repreſent and give luſtre to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as we ſhall ſhew in the ſeveral Particulars, when we have, firſt, given ſome Account of the Reaſon and Uſe of this Undertaking; and ſecondly, In a brief Scheme preſented the Method of the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Service.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. The deſign of this Tract is, that ſo Excellent an Office may be performed with a ſuitable Devotion. And in order thereto, we have not only Explained all the Parts thereof, but by proper Meditations and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all along have fitted it for the exerciſe of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Devotion, during the whole Adminiſtration. We have indeed many admirable Books for our help in this Sacrament; but they being generally deſigned for the Cloſet, the Affections which were elevated in Private, are apt to grow looſe and unactive when the Publick Service doth begin. Whereas this Diſcourſe, following the Order appointed for the Celebration in the Church, doth entertain the Devout Communicant all the way, with moſt pertinent Meditations; Moſt of which by
<pb facs="tcp:99778:7"/> frequent reading them in Private, may be made ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, that the hearing that part of the Office will bring them into our minds in their proper ſeaſons. For there will be little opportunity during the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to uſe the Book, unleſs while the Miniſter is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to our Brethren; all which time may be ſpent in thoſe Meditations upon the Form of Adminiſtration. And yet though we were obliged to follow the Method of the Liturgy, we have endeavoured ſo to contrive it, that they who deſire variety, or want other helps, may be aſſiſted hereby in Private alſo. So that you will here find directions, not only for your deportment at this Sacrament, but alſo for your preparation to it, and demeanour afterwards. And though no part hereof be improper for ſuch as would Communicate, to read, or Meditate upon: Yet for your better advantage, we have added the following Directions concerning the Order, wherein ſome ſpecial parts of it are to be uſed, by ſuch as deſire to be Worthy Receivers.</p>

                        <p>As our natural Ignorance makes it neceſſary to teach us this Law of God in our <hi>Catechiſm:</hi> So our aptneſs to forget that which is good requires that it ſhould be repeated in our publick Service.

                        <p>And to that purpoſe, Firſt, You muſt with great humility receive them from the Mouth of the Miniſter, as if they were ſpoken from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (imitating the tenderneſs of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>

                           </note> for therefore have you lived at random, becauſe you have not conſidered your ways, nor compared them ſtrictly with Gods ſacred Law. But now that you are freſhly minded of your Duty, and reproved for your former Neglect, It will be expected you ſhall be more afraid to tranſgreſs hereafter, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring never more to offend, ſay, <hi>Lord incline my heart to keep this Law.</hi> And thus the hearing of the Ten Commandments may be an exerciſe of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99778:17"/> and a means of amendment every day.</p>
                        <p n="4">§. 4. It is of excellent uſe frequently to compare our ways with Gods Law, for ſo it would be our guide before we act, to put us upon our Duty; Our reprover after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to bring us to Repentance; and our Monitor to prevent the like miſdoings for the future. But I am the briefer in this conſideration, becauſe my main deſign tends to the Holy Sacrament; And alſo becauſe the Church hath here placed the Ten Commandments prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as the Rule and Meaſure of <hi>that Examination</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes to be neceſſary before we eat thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. For the ſame Apoſtle teacheth us, that <hi>by the Law</hi> is the knowledge of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. And experience alſo ſheweth that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way to diſcover our iniquities and humble us for them, than the ſerious application of this exact Rule to our perverſe and crooked paths. I ſhall therefore, Secondly, Give Directions how we may ſo try our ways by them, as to prepare our ſelves for this Heavenly Feaſt. To which purpoſe let it be conſidered, that this duty of Self Examination, is never ſo neceſſary, as now when we purpoſe to receive the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For it is but hypocriſie to ſeek a pardon for ſins which we never perceived our ſelves guilty of, and fooliſh preſumption to make a Covenant before we have weighed the conditions to which we are to be obliged: Until we ſee the number and apprehend the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our tranſgreſſions, and fear the vengeance due unto us for them, we are altogether unfit for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his Death who ſuffered for our offences. It is the ſight and ſenſe of ſin alone that will ſhew us what need we have of ſo glorious a Redeemer. This will ſhew us our obligation to Jeſus, and teach us hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to praiſe God for him, and paſſionately to beg an intereſt in him: whileſt he that doth not diſcern his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99778:18"/> guilt, nor foreſee his danger, is ſtupid and unmoved at this amazing ſpectacle of a bleeding, languiſhing, dying Saviour, and hath no love nor no fear, No tears nor no deſires, No relenting or indignation for what is paſt, Nor any vows and wiſhes as to the time to come; and ſhall be judged an unworthy Receiver. So that if you deſire comfort in, benefit from, or acceptance at the holy Table, I charge you to be exceeding curious and diligent in this Examination.</p>
                        <p>The Pythagoreans and better ſort of Heathens did ſtrictly call themſelves to an Account every night before they went to ſleep, where they had been? what evil they had done? or what good they had left undone? And ſhall not they condemn thoſe Chriſtians who will not do the ſame once in a Month, or three or four times in a Year; eſpecially upon ſo ſolemn an occaſion, and for ſo excellent an end, as to procure a pardon ſealed for all their miſdemeanours? The Rabbins perſwade the devouter Jews to ſpend a whole Month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before the Feaſt of Expiation,<note place="margin">Buxtorf. Synag. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. c. <hi>18.</hi>
                           </note> in examining all their lives, aſſuring them that all thoſe offences which they diſcover ſhall be forgiven them in that great day: Which may more truly be applied to this Ordinance. That holy Anchoret which the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> found in the Egyptian deſarts, ſaid, he had imployment enough there (where he had nothing elſe to divert him) for his whole life to judge and condemn himſelf. And ſhall not we be juſtly condemned of the Lord, who think a day or two, too much to be ſo imployed? But I hope I need add no more to perſwade to ſo good a work. And therefore ſuppoſing this a ſufficient Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to thoſe who have any care of their Souls; I ſhall proceed to direct how we muſt examine our ſelves by theſe Commandments.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99778:18"/>§. 5. When the Miniſter gives warning of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Communion, We muſt contrive to have at leaſt one whole day ſeparated to this ſo neceſſary Trying and judging our ſelves. And firſt, As this Law was given in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.1. So we cannot uſe it in a crowd; but when we purpoſe thus to apply it, we muſt retire from the World, and lay aſide all ſecular buſineſs,<note n="h" place="margin">Seceſſi de populo, in me unicum negotium eſt mihi. <hi>Tertul. de pall. c. 5.</hi>

                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. and carry our minds with us into ſome place of privacy, that we may wholly attend this great work, which will take up our whole time, and imploy all our faculties. For we communicate ſo ſeldom, and generally live ſo careleſly between one time and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that our Sins are numerous, our Conſciences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, and many things forgotten, and all confuſed; So that it is not for us to alledge that the Primitive Chriſtians did not uſe ſuch ſolemnity of Preparation; For they lived ſtrictly, received daily or weekly, and kept their Souls always in good Order: For which cauſe I ſuppoſe neither were the Commandments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read in the Antient Liturgies. Did we lead ſuch lives, we might be accepted with leſſer and ſhorter preparatives. But moſt of our hearts will tell us the caſe with us is far otherwiſe. Secondly, Having thus choſen a time and place for the undiſturbed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this grand affair, we muſt reſolve to ſpend it Faſting, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. not only that we may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or loſe any of this precious time by our meat, but that our minds may be more ſpiritual, and more clear, our body more gentle, and more at the command of the Spirit,<note n="i" place="margin">Infirmitas carnis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorem mentis exacuit, ut affectis artubus, vires corporum in virtutes transferantur animorum. <hi>Salv. lib. 1. de prov.</hi>
                           </note> that our hearts may be tender, and more apt to grieve for Sin, and fear Gods wrath; as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99778:19"/> alſo that we may puniſh our fleſh, for the gratifying of which, moſt of our Sins have been committed; that we may acknowledge our ſelves unworthy of our daily bread; And finally declare that we deſire peace with God, more than our very food, and do ſo earneſtly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after Jeſus, that we forget our bodily ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Thirdly, Begin this work with humble and hearty Prayer to him that ſees your heart, and muſt be your Judge. Beſeech him to help you to prevent his judgment by condemning your ſelves. Deſire him to fix your thoughts, ſtrengthen your memory, and to work upon your affections; that you may perceive how often, how heinouſly, and how long time you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and may with a relenting wounded heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the ſame. Fourthly, After this riſe up, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate how merciful thy God hath been, in not ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to his Tribunal as yet, and in giving thee this opportunity to prevent a ſad and final Doom. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy heart is deceitful, and not willing to ſee its own baſeneſs, or to diſcover its own ſhame, nor apt to cenſure it ſelf<note n="k" place="margin">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99778:23"/> the vanity of the young Man in the Goſpel, nor is it likely that he will now have the confidence to ſay as he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> For his own Conſcience will tell him in moſt inquiries that <hi>He is the Man;</hi> And accordingly the Church hath provided the Publican Confeſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> Which now may be fitly uſed, Firſt, As an humble and dolorous Confeſſion that we are Guilty, very Guilty; For when the Priſoner falls down and craves Mercy; It ſhews he is convinced of his fault, and in that phraſe is ſuppoſed to acknowledge it. Secondly, As a paſſionate, and earneſt Exclamation for Pardon, which now appears infinitely needful, when this black and dreadful Bill is ſet before us. Yet leſt all this ſhould not be ſufficient to produce that ſorrow and ſhame, which is neceſſary for this ſolemn Confeſſion, but our hearts remain ſtill obdurate and unrelenting, Let every one lay before himſelf theſe Conſiderations. Firſt, Meditate of the <hi>nature</hi> of all theſe Sins of which thou art guilty: They are the Actions of a poor help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depending Creature done againſt the holy Will, and moſt gentle and reaſonable Commands, of that Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty who could deſtroy thee in a Moment, and whom Angels and all the World beſides exactly do obey. And beſides, thou maiſt upbraid thy ſelf with the folly of Anger, the fury of Revenge, the filthineſs of Luſt, and the ſhame of Lying, the beaſtlineſs of Drunkenneſs, and the miſery of Covetouſneſs, the unreaſonableneſs of Pride, and the vanity of ſeeking humane Praiſe, the reſtleſneſs of Ambition, and the vexation of a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mind. Conſider the malignity of all Sin, and the baſeneſs of every particular, and ſurely it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear it was impudence and ingratitude, ſimplicity and madneſs in thee ever to commit them. Secondly, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of the <hi>number</hi> of them; And think that if there
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99778:24"/> be ſo much evil in one Sin, How deplorable is thy Caſe who haſt offended in ſo many kinds? Oh how often haſt thou acted or deſigned, the greater and more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wickedneſſes? And for (thoſe which we account) the leſſer, What is wanting in the odiouſneſs of the ſingle Acts thou haſt ſupplyed by frequent repetitions; Few days nay minutes paſſing in thy whole life, in which thou doſt not ſin in theſe inſtances. I doubt not but thy memory now preſents a vaſt number to thee; but alas thoſe that were never obſerved are far more, and thoſe that are forgotten are much more numerous than both, Yet theſe are all noted in the Records of Heaven; So that if thou couldeſt apprehend this formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it would lay thy confidence in the duſt, and ſtrike thee with amazement to conſider how many times thou haſt deſerved Condemnation. Thirdly, Meditate of the <hi>Deſert</hi> of theſe <hi>Sins, viz.</hi> that <hi>the wages of</hi> (any, the leaſt, unobſerved, or forgotten) <hi>ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. And then how many times haſt thou deſerved to be cut off? Conſider how thou art by theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions expoſed to the wrath of God, and to ſuffer all thoſe Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal miſeries, which the Righteous Judge of all the World hath threatned in his holy word. And if thy heart be apt to excuſe its faults, on pretence of a corrupt Nature, a violent Temptation, or a ſudden ſurprize, and will not believe, or fear that God is ſo highly diſpleaſed; then tell thy own Soul that for one offence, the Angels were caſt out of Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, and He that is the lover of Men, for lighter or fewer Crimes, doth lay dreadful Plagues and Miſeries upon thy Brethren; And God is no reſpecter of Perſons; He ſpared not his own Son, when he ſtood in the place of Sinners, and ſhall He ſpare thee? Oh look up to the Croſs of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and behold his Agonies and his Sorrow, hear his groans and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99778:24"/> cryes, obſerve his anguiſh and his pains. Is not God highly diſpleaſed with Sin, when he makes his own Son the Example of his wrath, to his offending Servants? In ſhort know, that if Repentance do not now procure thy Pardon, thou ſhalt have God and all Creatures thy Enemies, and maiſt juſtly expect Loſſes and Croſſes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Reproach, Diſeaſes and an evil Death; and (which is more horrid) to be deprived of the aids of Gods Spirit, and the offers of Grace, and to be left in thy own hardneſs and impenitency, as one that refuſeth to be reclaimed. And if any or all theſe have not yet faln upon thee, it is only becauſe the Lord will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time thou wilt ſeriouſly Repent; but thou art not acquitted, though he do awhile forbear. Fourthly, Meditate of thoſe <hi>Aggravations</hi> which make thy Sins worſe than thoſe of other Men, and that will convince thee that thou deſerveſt no leſs. For Firſt, Have not many of them been committed againſt thy knowledge, and reaſon; and in deſpite of all the checks and reluctancies of thy Conſcience? Secondly, And although thou haſt made ſo many vows, and taken ſo many reſolutions, never to act them more; yea and engaged this upon the holy Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood: Yet haſt thou not entertained them again? Thirdly, Have not all thoſe mercies and favours ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal, wherewith thy Heavenly Father hath courted thy Love, been abuſed by thee, and caſt away upon thee, when all this could not prevail, to make thee leave one luſt, or perſwade thee to give over piercing him that hath died for thee? Fourthly, Haſt thou not proceeded in thy evil Courſes, after all thoſe Examples of divine vengeance on others, and all thoſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which Sin hath brought upon thy own ſelf? Haſt thou feared any longer than the ſmart remained? Haſt thou not made the Almighty almoſt weary of Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99778:25"/> thee? and ſheweſt thou loveſt thy Sin too well to be eaſily torn from it? Fifthly, And finally how miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous have the effects of thy tranſgreſſions been? They have diſhonoured God, diſgraced thy Religion, incouraged the wicked to perſevere, incited the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to follow thy ſteps, and offended weak and tender Chriſtians. This is indeed a ſad ſtory, and if we rightly apprehend it, may make the beſt to cry out with tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deep contrition, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us!</hi> But leſt this diſmal Account which will ſcarce fetch one ſigh from a ſtupid Soul, ſhould overwhelm others in grief and deſperation; I ſhall add, that we are not like the Jew, who when the Law thundered from Mount <hi>Eball,</hi> could only ſign it with a dreadful <hi>Amen,</hi> For we look further, and beholding the Lamb of God, make bold to crave mercy; the very acknowledgment of our Sin being wrapt up in a Petition for Pardon; And the right uſe of all this is, not to affright us from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but to drive us to him; to ſhew not only how little we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but how much we need a pardon; It is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent how far God can forgive, and how highly our dear Redeemer hath merited, ſeeing ſo great and deſerved vengeance is yet with-holden, and the Gate of Mercy ſtill kept open for ſuch wretched Creatures. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this diſcovery of Sin is to convince us, that it is high time to deſiſt from adding to this infinite heap, that it is extreamly neceſſary to ſeek for Abſolution, and that it will be an admirable ingaging favour, if we be again accepted. For Mount <hi>Sinah</hi> is the way to <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>the Law our School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt.</hi> When therefore your heart is full of theſe thoughts, and when hope and fear, ſorrow and deſire, are ſtrugling within you, In the midſt of theſe Paſſions, bend your knees and begin to arraign your ſelf at the Bar of your merciful Judge, where humble Confeſſion

Acknowledge therefore all you have found, relate your ſhame and indignation at your ſelf, your grief and anguiſh for all your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, intreat as for your life, and with all earneſtneſs beg for pity and pardon; remembring he never did caſt off any that thus came to him. Your Confeſſion it ſelf will be no other than a larger Paraphraſe, of <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99778:26"/>
                        <p>Firſt, How little of either true profit or ſolid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have I reaped from Sin? The gain is curſed and intangled, the delight ſhort, and unſatisfying, ending either in vexation or a reſtleſs deſire, which ſtays longer and wounds deeper than ever the fantaſtick pleaſure reached. How certain is it, that none of theſe purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can laſt beyond the ſhort duration of my frail life? and how little ſecurity have I that my death ſhall not be ere the next Morning? Secondly, How great a trouble yet have I had all my life for this trifling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reward? the gain was a ſhadow, but have I not thereby loſt my good name, or my health, my time, and my parts, the love of my beſt friends, and the hopes of Gods favour? Have not theſe Sins hindered my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, diſquieted my Conſcience, ſet my Neighbours againſt me, and filled my ways with loſſes, croſſes, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and evil Accidents? Have they not often made me ridiculous and baſe, hated and diſtruſted, and left me full of fears and ſad expectations, making my life uneaſie, and my death far more bitter and more terrible? Thirdly, But theſe are but the beginnings of ſorrow; For is it not as ſure as God is true, that if I perſiſt in them, I ſhall loſe all my intereſt in my only Saviour? forfeit all my hopes of Heaven? and ſell my title to the glorious Kingdom which is full of raviſhing and endleſs pleaſures, and all abundance of whatſoever heart can wiſh? And beſides this inſupportable loſs, ſhall not my Soul be condemned in the laſt dreadful judgment, and caſt into the Region of horror and darkneſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and torments that have no abatement, nor no end? Why then, Oh my Soul wilt thou buy theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſo dear? and be ſo abuſed by thy Enemies, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to thy dying Redeemer, and ſo miſchievous and cruel to thy ſelf? Wilt thou ever be ſo fooliſh and ſo deſperate to commit the like again? Say then, O my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99778:27"/> Soul, I abhor and renounce theſe accurſed deluſions, being almoſt enraged at my ſelf that I have been cheated with them ſo long; My reaſon is convinced, and my will perſwaded, that thy ways are the Right: Therefore, <hi>O Lord encline,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="10">§. 10. Secondly, To engage our minds to all the Duties of Religion and Piety, Juſtice, and Charity, that we may unalterably chuſe them, Let every one of us meditate,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Why ſhould I be backward to vow my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of God? Are they any thing elſe but a method of living well and wiſely, free from fears and injury? Do they not teach me to bear my ſelf ſo that I may win the favour of God and good men, and be ſafe in the beſt, and happy in the worſt condition? Can I wiſh my deareſt Friend, or my own Soul, a greater felicity than to be meek and patient, grateful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, temperate and induſtrious, juſt and bountiful, to converſe with God, rejoice with Angels, to imitate the Saints, follow the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to ſeek Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy? Secondly, Doth God require any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, unjuſt or unreaſonable? Am I to bind my ſelf to any more than that which my Judgment and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (when I am ſerious) tell me it is fit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for me to do, although it had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? Is it any more than that which all the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and beſt men, the friends of God and the Darlings of Heaven have done with the greateſt delight and pleaſure? and therefore it is the only proof of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble Spirit. Thirdly, Is not my God the beſt of all Maſters? who covers the infirmities, and ſtrengthens the weakneſſes of his Servants? Can I fail to pleaſe him who begets the deſire and enables for the performance? and makes the way familiar and eaſie, pleaſant and inviting, and yet where there is a hearty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99778:27"/> endeavour doth make many abatements, and accept the will for the deed,<note n="d" place="margin">Quia voluit, etiamſi non valuit adimplere. <hi>2 Cor. 8.12.</hi>

Fourthly, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſhall I not be rewarded with a glorious Crown in Heaven, for being ſo wiſe as to chuſe to be happy on Earth? Is not this the ſure way to the enjoyment of God, the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the Fellowſhip of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints and bleſſed Souls? to Eternal Peace, never-ceaſing Joy, to the moſt perfect and compleat felicity which ſhall laſt for ever, though the trouble of gaining it be but ſhort, and tranſitory? Be wiſe therefore Oh my Soul! and eaſily perſwaded to chuſe thine own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; And ſay, I deſire and long to be acquainted with theſe paths of pleaſantneſs, I chuſe and love them all. <hi>O Lord encline our hearts to keep theſe Laws.</hi> And now I hope it may be time to bend your knees again, and with a freſh bewailing of your tranſgreſſions, and many acknowledgments of your Conviction, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and proteſt againſt all iniquity; eſpecially, that by which you have been moſt apt to fall; and alſo to vow and engage, that you will lead a holy life; which you muſt do moſt ſeriouſly as in the preſence of God; And finally looking unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> the purchaſer of Pardon, and the giver of all Grace, moſt humbly beg the holy Spirit, that you may be enabled to keep this pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſince it is your wiſdom and happineſs never to break it more; to which purpoſe ſay, <hi>Lord write all theſe thy Laws in our hearts we beſeech thee.</hi> That is, in our memories and on our affections, that we might not offend againſt them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. For if his Spirit ingrave them on our Souls, we ſhall with eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure keep and do them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. Wherefore let us beg this favour moſt earneſtly, and let us not doubt of

For the particular choice of them, they are the very Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of the New Teſtament. And firſt, <hi>The Epiſtles,</hi> are either plain and preſſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to ſome neceſſary Chriſtian Duties, or rare diſcoveries of Gods mercy, or gracious promiſes of Pardon and Aſſiſtance. And they are firſt read in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that firſt Miſſion of the Apoſtles, when they went before their Maſters face to every City whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt would come, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. that the Epiſtle may be as the Harbinger for the Goſpel. And ſure it is fit, theſe being the words of the Servants, that the laſt place and greateſt honour be reſerved to the words of their and our Maſter. Secondly, For the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it is either ſome remarkable Hiſtory of Chriſts Life, or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99778:34"/> Death, ſome Eminent Miracle, or ſome curious Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and part of his Divine Sermons; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſt read, becauſe the Epiſtles do uſually contain inſtruction in the Myſteries of Salvation, but the Goſpel preſents the Example of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to the imitation whereof all our knowledge is but ſubſervient, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. And to this may be referred ſurely that ancient cuſtom of ſtanding up at the reading of the Holy Goſpel, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enjoined by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Liturgies,<note n="r" place="margin">

The Goſpel hath ſuch affinity to Chriſt, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the word of God, and bears the name of our Lord. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. To receive Chriſt, and to entertain his word with Faith, is all one. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to believe the Goſpel is called eating Chriſts fleſh, and drinking his blood, <hi>John</hi> 6. and is a kind of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion; Wherefore it is fitly read before this Sacrament, and at the Altar, even when there is no Celebration, becauſe we muſt hearken to it with the like reverence, receive it with the like joy, and return it with the like gratitude, as if <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf was ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, or viſibly preſent with us. For thus the Greek Liturgy orders.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Sapientiam &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem Dei hunc eſſe omnes credentes, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamus, Gloria tibi Domine. <hi>S.

Do you but endeavour to hear it with Faith, ſo as you may obey and imitate, and then you ſhall have great reaſon to break forth into the Divine Praiſes. If you remember the ſad tidings of Condemnation, which the Law lately ſounded in your Ears; Oh how welcome muſt the proſpect of ſo ſweet a Saviour, and the news of ſo gracious a Pardon be unto you!

                        </note> only we ſhall briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the neceſſity, and the manner of uſing it aright in order to the Holy Communion. Firſt, You may remember that this Sacrament doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a firm and affectionate belief of every one of theſe Principles, and is a ſuperſtructure raiſed upon this Foundation, ſo that the leaſt doubt or heſitancy in theſe main Articles will make the Soul lame in the whole Performance; nor can you be a worthy receiver unleſs you do fully believe the Majeſty of the Father whom you have offended, the Divinity, Incarnation, Paſſion and Reſurrection of the Son, by whom you ſue
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99778:36"/> for Pardon, as alſo the divine nature and ſanctifying efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby you hope to be enabled to keep your Covenant, and ſo in all the reſt; Eſpecially ſince this Communion is the peculiar badge and cognizance of Chriſtians, wherein we do avow the Lord Jeſus to be our Maſter, and publickly own our ſelves Diſciples of his Religion, for ſo both Jews and Gentiles by eating of their ſeveral Sacrifices, did declare they were Servants of that Deity to whom the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was preſented, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. And thus (as <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> tells us) the various Sects of Philoſophy, had their <hi>Sympoſia</hi> and Commemoration Feaſts, wherein they did remember their Founder, and profeſs themſelves Abettors of his Opinions; in like manner do we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt our Faith in Jeſus by this divine Feſtival, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary that we do firſt repeat the proper Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this Religion, as the Rules by which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to live, and as ſuch infallible truths for which (if need require) we will not refuſe to die. Secondly, Let us then devoutly ſay over this our Creed before the Sacrament eſpecially, and as we go along entertain every Article not only with an aſſent of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but with the conſent of our Will, and the compliance of our affections, being not only confident of their truth becauſe God hath revealed them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with their excellency, becauſe they tend to make us holy and happy; and then we ſhall believe them with a perſwaſion ſtronger than can be built upon the Scholaſtical Demonſtration; we ſhall adhere to them cloſely and for ever, becauſe they are amiable, and lead us to God and immortality: Let us not think our Faith ſufficient till we ſo believe in Jeſus as our Lord and Saviour, that we are moved thereby to repent of our ſins, and caſt our Souls on him for Pardon, and then we have ſpiritually communicated already, we have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99778:37"/> obtained the benefits and perfected the deſigns of this Sacrament, and done that internally and nakedly by Faith, which is more ſolemnly effected in the Myſteries themſelves. To which there is no better preparation, than ſuch a repetition of our Holy Faith.</p>

                        <p>O Lord, I give thee a ſmall part of thine own, who haſt given me all my Earthly Comforts; yea thy own Son out of thy boſom, to become my Salvation; and haſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to adopt me an heir of thy Glories; Oh that I could give a thouſand times more, thy love deſerves it, but this alas I give not as a requital of thy favour; but a teſtimony how much more I owe unto thee: but my Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot extend to thee who needeſt nothing, only ſweeteſt Jeſus, I do gladly embrace my poor Brethren, thy Friends, whoſe Souls thou haſt purchaſed with thy deareſt blood, and made them with me Heirs of the ſame glory. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that thou accepted ſo ſmall a matter to them as done to thy own ſelf. Behold therefore, I beſeech thee, a Soul ſo ſick and leprous, poor and naked, that it needs thy mercy, more than the miſerableſt Creature in the World my Charity. Oh how many and how earneſt Prayers do I need? Could I engage all the poor on Earth (whoſe Prayers ſooneſt pierce the Clouds) I need all this, and much more to make way for mine acceptance; But O my Saviour this is a Day of grace, in which thou ſcattereſt thy bounties. Wherefore remember my Soul, which is undone without thy pitty, and ſince thy mercies are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than ours, Lord do not paſs me by; Far be it from me to think ſo meanly of thy love, as to eſteem my Alms the purchaſe of it. No, no, I do only by this ſmall token give thee the Livery and Seiſin of me and all mine, and having vowed to purſue a more plorious intereſt, and to ſeek thy Kingdom, I do renounce the riches of this World, which I will never value, more than as they may ſerve to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99778:49"/> relieve thy members, and mak me friends, that I may be received into everlaſting habitations. Oh happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and admirable way of Gain! But ſo thou art wont to deal with us O God, to accept trifles from us, and give glories to us, great, and endleſs, and inexpreſſible; I adore thee O my Lord! and I love thee infinitely, and becauſe no Earthly gift can bear proportion to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodneſs; I will give my Soul alſo, and it ſhall be thine for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>Sect. 3. <hi>Almighty and Everliving God who by thy Holy Apoſtle haſt taught us to make Prayers and Supplications and to give thanks for all men.]</hi> Theſe two glorious Attributes of Omnipotence and Eternity, ſo clearly diſtinguiſh God from all Creatures, and are ſo properly the Character of an infinite Majeſty, that he is ſometimes called the <hi>Almighty, Pſal.</hi> 91.1. <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. and ſometimes <hi>He that liveth for ever, Dan.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.9. without any other denomination, wherefore they are placed here, to ſtrike a Religious reverence into us, becauſe of his infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to whom we make this Addreſs, and yet alſo to confirm our Faith, and excite our hope, that (though we petition for ſo many perſons and ſo great Bleſſings) we ſhall be heard by him who is mod mighty in Power, and who hath through all times preſerved his Church, and though one Generation goeth and another cometh, yet he ever liveth, and is always the ſame. But that which may ſtill encreaſe our hope is, that this Almighty and Everliving God, is not only able to grant theſe Prayers, but hath expreſly commanded us by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to make them, 1 <hi>Ep. Timothy</hi> 2.1. <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort therefore that</hi> firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all Men: Now had he not intended to grant them, he would not have enjoined us to make them; ſhall <hi>Eſther</hi> fear to ſpeak or to ſpeed when the King commands her to ask, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.3.? or will the Lord reject that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is drawn up by his own Direction? Behold how cloſely the Church hath followed the Apoſtles Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory;

This for the kinds of our Requeſts; now the Perſons for whom we are to pray are, all men, which ſurely God commands in purſuance of thoſe Precepts of Univerſal Charity, of which this univerſal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is an excellent indication. For no man can pray for all the World, if he hates any one perſon, he that prays for all, muſt be in Charity with all, and it is alſo an effectual means to oblige all people to us, and tame the furies of our Enemies, it being barbarous and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infamous to proſecute thoſe that heartily pray for our good: And now if our hearts be filled with true Chriſtian Charity, ſuch as is neceſſary for this holy Communion, we cannot but rejoice to meet ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an opportunity to expreſs our deſire of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all Mankind. Let us then with all poſſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion offer up this Sacrifice; Love this pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent interceſſion, which is enjoined by him that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to grant it, and printed by Charitable Souls, who will infinitely rejoice in the ſucceſs thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the proſperity of the whole Church.</p>

                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:99778:54"/>§. 4. <hi>We humbly beſeech thee moſt mercifully</hi> [to accept our Alms and Oblations, and] <hi>to receive theſe our Prayers, which we offer unto thy Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty]</hi> It ſeems to have been the Cuſtom when any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought their Offerings to the Altar for the Prieſt and the Pious By-ſtanders to ſay, <hi>The Lord accept thee, Pſal.</hi> 20.3, 4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.23. in imitation whereof, we do here beg the Divine acceptance both of our Charity and Devotion; And that we may do it heartily, let us conſider, how much they need to be accepted with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable allowances; for firſt, If Alms and Prayers both be offered (as it is pitty they ſhould ever be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) though they do aſſiſt and recommend each other, yet we do not think our gift hath obliged God to hear our Petitions, nor our Petitions given ſuch priviledge to our gift, as that we may boldly challenge God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of either, wherefore we deſire him with favourable and gracious acceptance to entertain them both. Secondly, If we reſpect the Alms alone, which we have given, though it be owned by Gods goodneſs to be offered to himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. and <hi>Math.</hi> 25.40. yet it were an arrogance not to be endured, to think ſo Univerſal and excellent bleſſings were the purchaſe of our contemptible oblation, which hath no proportion in its own value to them, only if we preſent it humbly, our gracious father will accept it as our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his goodneſs, and a teſtimony of our Love. Thus therefore we pray that he would accept our Alms, <hi>viz.</hi> in mercy, eſteeming them not by their own worth, but by the affection of the Givers. Thirdly, If we do only regard our Prayers, we may ſoon diſcover how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they will avail unleſs the Lord accept them with grace. As to thoſe we have hitherto made, if we look back upon the many wandrings and interruptions, the coldneſs and indifferency, the ſin and infirmity, that did
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99778:54"/> mingle with them all; we ſhall ſee we had need heartily to beſeech God to accept them with benign interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to excuſe the imperfections of them: But if <hi>[theſe our Prayers]</hi> be meant of thoſe Petitions which we are now about to make in this Form; let us remember how great a preſumption it ſeems for us to ask for others; nay for all people, when as we are not worthy to pray for our ſelves; yet let us humbly beg a candid acceptance of theſe Petitions, which we offer, not as if we were fit Advocates for all the World, but in obedience to his Command, who hath bid us thus to expreſs our Charity.</p>
                        <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Beſeeching thee to inſpire continually the Vniverſal Church with the Spirit of Truth, Vnity, and Concord:]</hi> Among the ſeveral Prayers which were made at the Holy Table it was particularly enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould pray for, <hi>The Holy Catholick Church, extended from one end of the Earth to the other, which the Lord had redeemed veith the precious blood of Chriſt;</hi> ſaith the Author of the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions;</hi> for the Sacrifice here commemorated was offered for the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. which is called the body of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.24. but becauſe the body without the ſpirit is dead, we therefore beg, that as he once quickened the lump of Earth into a living Spirit, by breathing into it the breath of Life, ſo he will pleaſe to inſpire his Holy Spirit into his myſtical body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. and that not only once, <hi>John</hi> 20.22. but that it may continually be ſupplyed with vital influences, by its Union with its Divine Head the Lord Jeſus, the bleſſed ſucceſs whereof is noted in the three happy effects of this Heavenly Inſpiration. Firſt, That the Church will be directed into all Truth by the Spirit of Truth, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. and 16.13. 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.27. and ſo be preſerved from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.

Thirdly, That the affections of all perſons in this body ſhall be joined in perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and tied in the Bonds of Love and Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3. for the prevention of hatred, wrath, and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: How paſſionately therefore is this bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be prayed for? and how neceſſary are all and every one of theſe? Truth without Unity is weak and troubleſome, Unity without Truth is dangerous and miſchievous,<note n="e" place="margin">

                           </note>, but it is our duty to keep a perpetual memorial, of that moſt valuable, and never to be forgotten propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. For thereby alone (and not by the merits or Prayers of Saints or Angels) our Salvation was obtained. Now if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins, and the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Heaven for us (who were Heirs of Hell) be the greateſt mercies, conſider with what devout affections we ſhould celebrate the memorial of that which was the price thereof. How far did the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the deſtroying Angel come ſhort of this? and yet that was thought worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the ſolemnity of a Paſsover, ſo long as the Nation did endure. We cannot then think that this can be remembred to the end of the World (as it ought to be) unleſs we proclaim it early, and prepare for it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99778:69"/> diligently, and celebrate it with the deepeſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; alas we can never imprint it ſufficiently upon our Souls, without frequent and ſerious Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he doth not underſtand or not conſider the excellency of this mercy of our Redemption, that doth not wiſh it were written on his heart in indelible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and carefully ſet himſelf (upon this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to prepare to make the moſt grateful memorial of his enfranchiſement by the Death of Jeſus.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99778:69"/> ſuppoſed to deſcend upon all that were admitted to eat thereof. Now this pledge of Gods peculiar love, and this ſeal of a gracious Pardon, doth give ſuch courage and ſtrength to poor Sinners, that the believing it is called ſpiritual food and nouriſhment, and eating and drinking the body and blood of Chriſt: for it even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes the Soul of the humbled Penitent to receive ſuch a Teſtimony of Gods being reconciled to him. Hence are all thoſe ecſtaſies of joy which holy Men here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and God hath on purpoſe inſtituted this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be a moſt ſolemn and myſterious manner of offering up theſe humble and hearty thanks, for which cauſe it is called <hi>the Cup of bleſſing</hi>

On the other ſide our ſpiritual guide conſiders, that for the obſtinate and prophane, for thoſe that have ſinned, and will ſin, it is very dangerous to preſs into this Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Banquet, for ſuch preſume meerly upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, and would fain perſwade themſelves, this will acquit their old ſcores, ſo that they may more freſhly begin to ſin again; but God is not ſo mocked, and therefore they provoke him, abuſe the myſtery, and delude their own Souls. Wherefore upon the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry the Miniſter doth exhort us to ſpend the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and the Sacrament well, for if we come not to it, we loſe this divine comfort, if we come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, we run into an unknown danger; he is unwilling therefore we ſhould be deprived of the comfort, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the miſchief: And therefore he doth exhort us to prepare, for ſo we ſhall be ſure of the advantage, and avoid the Evil.

And theſe are no more than what every prudent man conſiders before he ſet upon any great affair. Firſt, He ſurveys the nature of the work. Secondly, He examines his own fitneſs to undertake it. Thus did <hi>Solomon</hi> when he was to build the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.3.8, 9. and when a marriage with <hi>Sauls</hi> Daughter was propoſed to <hi>David; Seemeth it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a light thing</hi> unto you to be a Kings Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo muſt we meditate of this divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſay to our own Souls: O how dreadful is this place! <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.17. ſeemeth it a ſmall thing unto thee to be feaſted with God, waited on by Angels, fed with the body of Jeſus, and refreſhed with a Cup of that ſaving blood which hath attoned the ſins of the World? What meaneth this ſecret? that ſo poor a Wretch, and ſinful a Rebel, ſhould receive ſo mighty a favour, and be received to ſo near embraces? How can I approach to theſe Terrible Myſteries till I have pulled back the Veil, and worſhipped him that feeds my body to convey grace to my Soul, and makes that ſtoop to the Eye of ſenſe, which Angels cannot behold with open faces? The Miniſter's conſidering this before, doth not excuſe us from conſidering it alſo, but we our ſelves muſt (as he adviſeth) conſider withal the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make us full of deſires, and humble; and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to put us upon the ſtricteſt care and preparation; And if the peril of unworthy receiving do only make us more diligent to come well, it becomes its own Cure, and the conſideration of this danger makes, that really there is none to thoſe who come humbly, eſteeming this Ordinance as it doth deſerve.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt take heed that we do not this <hi>lightly,</hi> only out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom before a ſolemn time, or meerly that we may ſeem to have done it; as moſt men do, who only gently touch theſe ſores, and give a ſlight and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial glance, at ſome of their greateſt or lateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſins, but never care for ſearching into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and looking into the inward Corners of their Corruptions. Theſe, alas, are but <hi>Diſſemblers</hi> with God: who only ſeek for ſome matter to confeſs, and tell a ſad ſtory, without any ſorrow or real purpoſes of amendment, yet call this preparation, and come to this Sacrament with expectations of pardon and acceptance. But truly we had as good do nothing, neither God nor Conſcience will ſo excuſe us; we do but loſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and cheat our ſelves with a ſhadow for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, unleſs we do it impartially, and with real deſigns to ſee our ſins clearly, and be humbled deeply for them, ſo that we may hate and forſake them for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

It is not that men may think we have duly prepared, but that the All-ſeeing God may receive us, that is treat us nobly, and entertain us kindly (as the word to receive ſignifies, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.17.) at this Heavenly Banquet: And can we think a formal ſearch will procure theſe graces, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for the divine acceptance: nothing leſs than a through Repentance will ſuffice to this end, and how to perform that the next Paragraph will diſcover.</p>

Many of theſe Perſons have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the firſt part of preparation; <hi>viz.</hi> a true ſorrow for ſin: let them therefore endeavour to add the ſecond, that is, a lively Faith. If they ſay, they are ſo ſinful, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe there is any mercy for them; I ask, why? is God ſo hard to Sinners? whom he doth court and wooe to turn to him, proteſting he deſires not their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, but longs for their reſtauration? hath he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Son for Sinners, and ſent his Miniſters to them, and offered his grace and glory alſo to engage them to return and live? to be afraid to live in ſin is ſomething, but to be afraid to come in, when our heart is humbled for it, and deſirous to be quit of it, is moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but let them entertain better thoughts of God, and in all humility venture to approach; if they ſtay in their ſin they die, and if God ſhould reject them they can but die; but oh bleſſed venture! to commit their Souls to that infinite mercy, which never did caſt off any in this Caſe: they that are Sinners, and are ſenſible thereof, either at preſent, or quickly, may be fit to come to this Celeſtial Banquet; therefore let not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of former ſins keep any back, who are now hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them. Thirdly, Thoſe who live in open and notorious ſins, do alſo make this excuſe, that they dare not receive the Sacrament becauſe they are ſo grievous Sinners. But to theſe we cannot give ſo gentle an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99778:89"/> For though they muſt not come ſo long as they are Drunkards and Adulterers, Swearers or malicious, yet becauſe they are thus by their wilful wickedneſs, it doth not extenuate but aggravate the Crime of abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; becauſe they have made themſelves unfit. Were it not a ſtrange excuſe in a Jewiſh Prieſt, daily to touch dead bodies, and ſo plead he was excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from attending on the Sacrifice? would he not deſerve a double puniſhment both for wilful defiling himſelf, and then for making that a pretence to neglect his Duty?

                           </gap>mſelves, that they reverence theſe myſteries, and dare not prophane them by coming to them, but nothing is more falſe, for if they fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, why are they not afraid to live in abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins which he hates? Is there more danger in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, than in being drunk and adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, violent or revengeful? or do they imagine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will damn them but this Holy Food? Alas it is not ſtaying from the Communion that will keep off Damnation, but a ſincere and ſpeedy Repentance. Hence the Church hearing them confeſs they are Sinners, asks them ſharply why then do they not Repent? for then they might come hither without danger; and truly if they repent not, they ſhall periſh although they ſtay away; ſo that if they could conſider, God hath brought them into a happy neceſſity of repenting, for without that, if they come to the Altar, they die as coming unworthily, if they forbear and continue in ſin, they die alſo; ſo that there is but one way left. We do
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99778:89"/> not exhort men therefore to come in their ſins, but to caſt away their ſins that they may come worthily, and therefore we give them notice ſo long before. If they ſay a week is too little time to do this great work of Repentance in, let them ask themſelves why they put it off till Death, when perhaps they may not have an hour? and can ſuch Perſons be ſure that their Death is not nearer than this next Sacrament? If they think it be too ſudden to reſolve to leave their Sins, let them bluſh to ſay they are not yet reſolved, and beware that the time do not come when they ſhall wiſh they had done it ſooner. It is poſſible that ſcandalous and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sinners cannot be fit againſt the next Communion, but then they muſt lament their unfitneſs, and ſpend all the time they can, to be prepared for the next after, and only forbear for once, that they may come with more Comfort ever after: And to plead they are ſinful, and never ſtrive to amend, but to neglect Receiving from time to time, is a Declaration that men have ſinned, and will ſin, and intend not to be troubled with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or tyed to a religious courſe of life, and therefore they avoid this Sacrament as a thing which is inconſiſtent with their purpoſes of going on in ſin: Wherefore neither is this excuſe ſufficient to hold us back.</p>

Our being ready is a good Argument why we ſhould ſpeedily and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently prepare, but no Apology for our ſtaying away; and truly he that will not labour to fit himſelf for this Sacrament, will ſcarce repent upon any other occaſion, and he that often ſays he is not ready thus to meet Chriſt at his firſt Coming; will be ſtrangely ſurprized at his ſecond, and doubtleſs be as unready then: Beſides, are we not told of theſe holy times long enough before? had we any love for Jeſus we ſhould begin early to adorn our ſelves, as that Jewiſh Doctor who put on his beſt habit on <hi>Friday</hi> in the Afternoon, and ſat longing for the Sun-ſetting (the time when the Jewiſh Sabbath begins) and ſaid, <hi>Veni Sponſa, Come my Spouſe,</hi> for ſo he called that Sacred Day. The Church Hiſtory relates that St. <hi>Catherine</hi> was wont to long for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as the Child for its Mothers Breaſts; but we are glad of an excuſe to ſhift it off, and neither deſire it, nor prepare for it, on purpoſe that we may ſay we are not ready. Theſe are fine pretences to ſtop the mouths, and blind the Eyes of Men, and ſerve us to cozen our ſelves with, but they are vain and inſignificant before him that looks through theſe thin Veils, and ſees other Cauſes which keep us away from the Altar, which we would gladly conceal; for God perceives that many which make theſe excuſes do really forbear the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, either becauſe, 1.

For this Cauſe the Antient Church appointed the Prieſts in great Cities to have a Communion every Day, ſo that devout people might always find the Table ſpread whenſoever they hungred after this Bread of Life; and in ſuch places our own Church ſtill makes monthly preparations, and alſo ſends the Miniſter to the Altar upon every great Feſtival, on

But when the Table is actually ſpread, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we ſhould need no other Oratory, than thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Symbols to invite us, did we know our need of that food, and were we acquainted with the pleaſures of that Celeſtial Banquet, we ſhould be attracted with the very ſight of the Elements, and long, yea languiſh to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of them; and ſure they upbraid thoſe wretches who go away, and turn their backs upon them; but there are ſome who cannot or will not hear this ſtill voice; and therefore the Miniſter doth once again, <hi>ex officio,</hi> invite us, in the Name of God who is the great Maſter of this Feaſt, and in the behalf of Chriſt, who is the precious food there provided, beſeeching us that we will not by neglecting affront the great God, and ſlight his dear Son; and further exhorting us by the moſt cogent Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> for our own ſakes, as we love our Souls, as we fear to be Condemned, and wiſh for Salvation, that we will come. <hi>Cicero</hi> thought a man might as ſoon run away from himſelf, as loſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after thoſe things which conduced to his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs<note n="h" place="margin">Prius à ſe pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quiſpiam diſcedere, quam appetitum earum rerum quae ſibi condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt amittere. <hi>lib. de fin. 5.</hi>

For if <hi>Jeſus</hi> thought our Salvation worth his Death, do we think it too dear of a little preparation? is he willing to bleed for our ſins, and are we not willing to weep for them? ſhall he yield up his Soul in the midſt of the moſt dolorous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and will not we yield up our Luſts, and come to remember his love in this Holy Sacrament?

They therefore that will not receive it, do caſt away Chriſts badge, and cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from the body of the Church, and refuſe to be bound in the Bonds of Love; indeed they declare themſelves no Members of this bleſſed Society, who may ſay to ſuch abſenters as St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8.21. <hi>Ye have neither part nor lot with us in this matter.</hi> Now how evil a thing this is, may appear in that they do what they can to diſcourage men from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving: and to breed ſcruples in the minds of thoſe who do Communicate, yea to caſt a diſgrace upon the

But let them beware of cutting themſelves off, from thoſe who are the Members of Chriſt, and ſo from their part of eternal life, ſince it is juſt to ſhut them out from the Communion of Saints in Heaven, who never would Communicate with them on Earth. There are many holy Perſons who do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, but theſe do not, and ſo are in a contrary way: if good men do well to come, why do they not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them? if they be in the way to Heaven, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters are going (I fear) to a worſe place. It may be there are ſome wicked perſons who are crowded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe myſteries, and ſome pretend they ſtay away becauſe of them; But let us beware of the Phariſees Pride, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.5. in bidding men ſtand off, for we are holier than they; the beſt men deſpiſe none, and uſually think themſelves the worſt of all, and how do we know, but they may be begun to be changed by Gods grace? however we are not judges, but the Church; our duty is to fit our ſelves, not to make all others ſo. We are to wiſh that all the Congregation were holy, but if all be not, we muſt not loſe our part in Gods Ordinances, becauſe an <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> may be there; if we be not like theſe perſons in their Sin, we ſhall not fare the worſe for them; God can diſtinguiſh though we ſit never ſo near in place, if we be diſtant in our qualities he will accordingly diſpenſe his favours: We muſt converſe with ſuch ſometimes in the World, where there is more danger they ſhould infect us, but here perhaps our devotion may do them good, but their guilt can do us no harm.</p>

For we are herein courteouſly invited, and earneſtly preſſed to come, our ſcruples are ſatisfied, our excuſes ſhewed to be vain, our duty is made evident, and our peril of neglecting it fully expreſſed; ſo that nothing but obſtinate purpoſes to deſpiſe Reaſon, and Example, the Injunctions of God, and the requeſt of our well-wiſhers, can after this keep us back.

The dreadful danger of coming unprepared. And firſt, if we bring with us a penitent heart and a lively Faith, the benefits are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo excellent, that whoſoever conſiders them cannot but long for them, and they that obtain them may deſpiſe all other pleaſures, becauſe they are as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as they can be on this ſide Heaven: and are they not worth a little pains to diſpoſe our ſelves for them? They are ſurely moſt unworthy of them who will loſe them, rather than ſubmit to the trouble of a ſincere Examination of themſelves. The particular benefits are here expreſſed in the words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.54, 55, 56. in that myſtical Sermon wherein he did ſecretly prepare the minds of his Diſciples for this Sacrament, ſhortly to be inſtituted, and clearly alludes to the ſame: The firſt benefit is the <hi>ſpiritual eating</hi> Chriſts body and blood. For the humbled Sinner believing in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Death and Paſſion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and receiving this Bread and Wine, in token that God hath given him for his ſins, and that he doth rely on him as his only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; This doth convey to ſuch a penitent Believer, all the benefits of the Birth, and the Death of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and as the Bread and Wine being received do communicate to us all the ſtrength and comfort that they contain; ſo the worthy Receiver by apprehending and embracing a Crucified Saviour, draws perſwaſions of his pardon, and encouragement to his Graces, and ſo hath <hi>ſpiritually</hi> eat the fleſh, and drunk the Blood of Chriſt, and hence flows the ſecond benefit, <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Dwelling</hi> or remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in us,</hi> and we in him; that is, when he have thus
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99778:99"/> received our Saviour, there is a bleſſed Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and our Souls, for he communicates of his fulneſs to us, and we open our neceſſities to him, and Thirdly, hereby there is produced ſo near <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> that God eſteems us as members of his dear Son, lays our ſin upon him, and imputes his ſatisfaction to us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all thoſe benefits are derived to us, which are mentioned by many, and found by the Devout Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, hope of pardon, encreaſe of Grace, aſſurance of our Reſurrection, and the expectation of Eternal Glory. <hi>O Bleſſed myſtery! which doſt communicate my Saviour, and convey his Graces to me, which giveſt me an intereſt in him, and makeſt me one with him, whom my Soul loveth. How am I raviſhed with the ſweetneſs of this Heavenly Feaſt? how ſtrongly do theſe benefits attract me? if any pains or coſt, trouble or difficulty, ſtand in my way, I will account the pains to be pleaſures, the coſt gain, the trouble delight, and the difficulty eaſineſs, which leads me to ſuch bleſſedneſs. O my Soul doſt thou not wiſh with all thy Powers to be reconciled to God, to be one with Chriſt, and to be filled with the Spirit? behold the means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh all theſe deſires; Do but examine into thy own heart, till thou relenteſt for thy ſins, and ſearch into Gods Mercy, till thou art perſwaded of his love. And with this penitent believing heart come, and partake of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Banquet, and (though thou doſt not preſs thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours fleſh with thy Teeth, which would do thee no good, yet) thou ſhalt really partake of all the benefits of his Death, and become one with him, and receive all from him that thy Soul doth either need or deſire.</hi>

                        <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>So is the danger great if we receive the ſame unworthily, for then we are guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt our Saviour, we Eat and Drink our own Damnation, not conſidering the Lords Body; we kindle Gods wrath againſt us, we provoke him to

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99778:108"/> Chriſt, maker of all things, Iudge of all men.]</hi> When the glories of God were deſcribed before holy <hi>Job,</hi> he immediately abhors himſelf in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. and there is not a more effectual inſtrument of contrition, than a ſerious proſpect of the Majeſty whom we have offended, hence the Servants of God in Scripture do uſually begin their Confeſſions with the mention of the Divine Power and goodneſs, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. And for this cauſe our Church hath ſelected four moſt comprehenſive Titles, which do moſt clearly ſet before us, the Greatneſs and the Goodneſs of that Lord againſt whom we have ſinned. We will therefore particularly conſider them, Firſt, As they contain matter of terror for our humiliation. Secondly, As they expreſs grounds of hope to encourage us to ask Pardon. 1. We may meditate that he whoſe Laws we have broken, is an <hi>Almighty God,</hi> infinite in Power, and terrible in his Anger, from whom nothing can defend us but ſubmiſſion, and a great humiliation; It was deſperate preſumption to offend him, and it is a ſtrange ſtupidity and madneſs, if we now be void of fear and ſorrow: Are we ſtronger than he? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. if not, why did we provoke him at firſt? or how dare we now ſtand out againſt him? 2. He is the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in him he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Fountain<note n="e" place="margin">Pater Hebraicè pro authore, vel fonte, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiae, ita <hi>Epheſ. 1.17. Job 38.28.</hi> &amp;c.</note> of all mercies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. and by him he hath expreſſed ſuch an affection to us, as all the World can never paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, and have we thus requited him? by profaning his name, diſobeying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, deſpiſing his love, and doing that which his Soul hateth? Oh monſtrous ingratitude! 3. He is the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things,</hi> and ſo may juſtly challenge obedience from all the World, nor is there any of his Creatures,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99778:109"/> but we alone, that are refractory to his will. Can there then be greater injuſtice than that we ſhould rob him of the ſervice we owe unto him, and abuſe him by thoſe very things which he hath made to ſerve our needs? 4. He is the <hi>Judge of all men, Gen.</hi> 18.25. at whoſe ſentence we muſt either be juſtified or condemned for ever, and yet inſtead of obliging him to ſtand our Friend, we have even urged him to become our Enemy, and forced him as he is juſt to paſs a dreadful doom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: Let us lay all this to heart, and his Power will ſhew the Boldneſs, his Love the Baſeneſs, his Title to us the Injuſtice, and his Authority over us the folly of every ſinful Act, and all together I hope will melt our rocky hearts, and make us ſincerely Penitent. 2. That we be not too much dejected, let us review theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes again, and we ſhall alſo find in them, motives ſufficient to ſupport our hope, and encourage us to ask forgiveneſs: For firſt, He is <hi>Almighty,</hi> even abſolute and ſupream; ſo that if he pleaſe he can forgive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, and none can reverſe his Acts of Grace. Secondly, He is the <hi>Father</hi> of our dear Redeemer, and in him loveth us with an everlaſting love, by him our Peace is made, ſo that through him we may go with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace. Thirdly, He is the <hi>Maker</hi> of all things, and of us among the reſt. Now he hateth nothing that he hath made, for his mercy is over all his Works, wherefore we may have good hopes that he will pity and help the work of his own hands. Laſtly, He is the <hi>Judge</hi> of all men, Let us therefore now make our ſupplication to him, for it is yet the time of mercy, <hi>Job</hi> 9.15. and he is now willing to help them whom he hath redeemed with his precious blood. Being thus prepared by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on theſe Attributes, we may fitly begin to confeſs as followeth.</p>

Then it becomes the Prieſt in Confidence of his Maſters Mercy to give them his beſt wiſhes and with more than an ordinary Prayer to ſignifie, as well as ask their pardon. You have ſaid with <hi>David, We have ſinned,</hi> wherefore God hath ſent his Miniſter like another <hi>Nathan,</hi> to aſſure you, that, <hi>He hath alſo put away</hi> the iniquity of your ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 13. And though <hi>David</hi> might by his Faith in the Promiſes have found ſome Comfort, yet neither ſo ſure nor ſo ſweet a conſolation as when he receives it from the mouth of a ſpecial Meſſenger. So likewiſe if we would chuſe to believe rather than diſpute, it would be a powerful Cordial to every troubled Spirit, by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Officer from the King of Heaven to be thus ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and he that cannot value this Abſolution from the Prieſt, can no other way receive ſatisfaction to his doubts and fears, unleſs he expect to be aſſured of his Remiſſion by an immediate Revelation, or can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtay till the day of Judgment for the Reſolution of this great enquiry. Only let us but be careful, that our Repentance be ſincere, and then we may with much joy hear the following Abſolution, which very briefly we ſhall now explain.</p>

For firſt, He minds them that he who is Almighty, and only can forgive, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.7. is alſo their Heavenly Father, and full of Compaſſion toward them, yea like as a Father pittyeth his own Children, even ſo is the Lord merciful

If ever we duly felt the weight of them, or apprehend the mercy of our deliverance, we are doubtleſs full of gratitude and ſhall gladly embrace this occaſion, to let our mouths tell the joy and the pleaſure which we feel within, upon ſo admirable a mercy. Laſtly, Let us alſo look forward, and conſider that we are juſt going to eat of theſe Coeleſtial Dainties, and ſo muſt not with a greedy impudence fall to them, till we have firſt worſhipped and praiſed him that did invite

Now for the uſe of theſe we muſt note, that as the greater Feaſts of the Jews continued ſeven or eight days, ſo theſe Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be repeated ſome days after the great day to which they principally belong, both that the mercy may be better remembred by often repetition, and alſo that all the people (who in many places cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in one day) may join in praiſing God for it: Which being the great end of them, the beſt method to promote that, and fit the receivers with peculiar praiſes for theſe ſolemnities, will be to ground a devout Meditation upon every one of theſe Prefaces; proper for thoſe who do partake of the myſteries at any of theſe Times.</p>

                           <p n="9">§. <hi>9.</hi> Welcome thrice bleſſed Day! the deſire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe diſtant glories made the Father of the faithful to rejoice, and whoſe approaches fill'd the World with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and expectation: thou wert uſhered in with Angelick Hymns, and celebrated ever ſince with Anthems of praiſe, becauſe thou didſt bring forth joy, and a Redeemer to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Happy am I that I have a Sacrifice of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in my hand, to expreſs the delight which my heart doth feel. This holy Table is the Altar upon which I offer my acknowledgments for all mercies, and oh how many, how great are thoſe which this day brings to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance! ſo infinite they cannot be expreſſed, and yet ſo excellent they muſt not be forgotten: This day hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Heaven and Earth, and made contradictions friends, to find a way to help us, as if nothing might diſagree when man was at peace with God: O my Soul, ſummon all thy powers to admire and worſhip: for all is Miracle, and the height of Wonder; Eternity begins to be, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all is made himſelf, an infinite Majeſty is ſhrunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dimenſions of a ſpan; The word is made fleſh, and God becomes Man, yet remains God ſtill. Here is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who knew no man, a Son that had no Father on Earth, a Child of <hi>Adam</hi> untainted with the Cantagion that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects all his Poſterity, an Infant honoured with a new and glorious Star, adored by Kings, worſhipped by Angels, yet born in the condition of the meaneſt fortune. All hail ſweeteſt Saviour, how lovely is thy condeſcenſion, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thy abaſement? thou haſt more ſplendor in the Rags of thy Humility, than all the Grandeurs of this World could give thee; thou art more a King becauſe thou
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99778:131"/> wouldſt be like a ſlave for our ſakes, and conquereſt more hearts by thy ſtupendious love and unparallel'd ſelf-denyal: O how ſhall I celebrate this great Solemnity? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal ſhall I ſet forth my gratitude for this moſt auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Day? I will receive the Cup of Salvation, and with raviſhments of delight feaſt upon that precious Body and Blood which Jeſus did this day aſſume for me. It is not enough deareſt Lord that thou waſt born for me, unleſs thou art alſo born again in me, and (as it were) become incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in my heart. In thy Birth thou waſt made one with us, thou didſt put on fleſh, and wert a partaker of our humanity. And thou haſt appointed this holy Sacrament that I might be one with thee, be repleniſhed with thy Spirit, and a partaker of thy divine nature. Nor is it any incongruity if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Paſſion and praiſe thee for thy Incarnation at once, for as ſoon as thou waſt born thou didſt begin to die, and the life which was here begun (compared to that glorious life which thou didſt leave) was it ſelf a very Death; but therefore thou waſt born, that thou mighteſt be capable to ſuffer that death for us which thy Divinity could not feel, and thus thy Nativity was the firſt Scene of thy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for it introduced thy Death, and that effected our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo that I will remember both together. For in both thou haſt moſt admirably humbled thy ſelf to the depth of miſery; and yet I doubt not but thou wouldſt have ſtooped lower if it had been either neceſſary or poſſible; But there needs no more teſtimonies of thy love. Bleſſed Jeſus! I am already overwhelmed with theſe which are ſo ſtrange and undeſerved, ſo ſweet and raviſhing, that my Soul could not contain, if it did not vent it ſelf in thy Praiſes. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Angels, &amp;c.</hi>

Thy former Birth did ſhew thee to be the Son of Man, but this declares thee to be the Son of God, and now we know that our Redeemer liveth; he that loved us ſo infinitely as to dye for us, doth now ever live to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on our behalf; he that expreſſed ſuch kindneſs to us in his Paſſion, hath ſo fully demonſtrated his own Power in his Reſurrection, that we are ſure he is as able as willing to deliver us.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99778:132"/> jubilee and rejoicing: Behold how nature is raiſing it ſelf from the grave of Winter, and ſeems annually to celebrate the memory of her Lords Reſurrection in her green and freſh attire: A ſeaſon choſen by God for Feſtival, <hi>3000.</hi> years ago, and obſerved ever ſince by Jews or Chriſtians, or both with the greateſt ſolemnity. See how thoſe blinded Jews rejoice over their Paſchal Lamb (in the midſt of all their Calamities) for the deliverance of their Fathers. But we have a nobler Paſsover, for a greater deliverance; Chriſt our Paſsover is ſacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the Feaſt, and that upon the precious Body and Blood of the Lamb of God who was ſlain but is alive again, and behold he lives for evermore. Wherefore I will go to thy <hi>Altar</hi> with joy, and tell <hi>out</hi> thy works with gladneſs, O moſt mighty Saviour who haſt not only died for my ſins, but riſen again for my Juſtification: and indeed what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort could I have found in this memorial of thy Death, if it had not been for thy Reſurrection? this Sacrament would have only remembred thy ſufferings, and renewed my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to think that ſo excellent a Perſon had periſhed in the attempt of my deliverance; but now it is become a Feaſt of joy, becauſe it is an aſſurance of thy Reſurrection, as well as a Commemoration of thy Paſſion: And ſince thou liveſt ſweeteſt Jeſus, we live alſo, thy Reſurrection raiſeth our hearts from ſad deſpair, it gives a new life to our hopes, it makes our ſorrows light, our labours eaſie, our lives, chearful, and our death advantage, becauſe it hath loſt its ſting and is become the gate into immortality: We can charm all our fears and troubles with this one word, <hi>The Lord is riſen,</hi> yea <hi>the Lord is riſen indeed:</hi> For thou haſt waſhed us in thy own blood, and made us Kings and Prieſts to God, to offer up at this thy Altar never-cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Praiſes. <hi>Therefore with Angels, &amp;c.</hi>

And now O my ſoul, why ſtandeſt thou gazing into Heaven, he is too high to be diſcerned, too bright to be ſeen with mortal Eyes, ſince Cherubins are dazled at his ſplendor. He is gone to his proper place, and aſcended thither, whither thy deſires carry thee, and where ere long thou ſhalt ſee him face to face: Thou ſtandeſt like <hi>Eliſha,</hi> looking after him and lamenting thy Maſters departure, but he hath left his Mantle behind him, even the myſteries of this holy Sacrament, which to thy Faith is the fleſh which he was cloathed with all, and is deſigned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a double portion of his ſpirit unto thee; ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he hath left his Love with us when his Perſon was taken from us.

Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great dignity of theſe terrible myſteries; had we the purity of an Angel, and the affections of a Seraphin, we could ſcarce be worthy to come ſo near to a moſt holy and All-ſeeing God, to lay ſuch claim to the bleſſed Jeſus and all his Merits, and to be ſo wholly united to him, as we are deſigning in this admirable Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

                        <p>Sixthly, To this we may finally annex many cogent reaſons why this Tranſubſtantiation is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it is needleſs for us to expect to eat the natural fleſh of Chriſt here, where we come to ſeek a ſpiritual Union with him by Faith, and an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his Death, to which the eating his fleſh would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conduce. Again, it is contrary to the nature of a Sacrament where the viſible part muſt remain (as the Water in Baptiſm doth) to be a foundation for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual grace: And further, ſince the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt contain Chriſts Body to the end of the World, it is impoſſible it ſhould be but one, and yet many, in ſeveral places at once, always whole, yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten broken, received intire by every perſon, and yet then at the right hand of God, exiſting before, yet Created by the Prieſt: We muſt deny our Reaſon as well as our Senſes, if we can believe ſo great and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Contradictions: Nor is it imaginable if this were the intent of our Lords words, how he who was then alive and ſitting at the Table, could break and give himſelf, or be eaten, and yet remain intire; and finally, ſince we ſee, and feel, and taſt it to be only Bread and Wine as to the ſubſtance ſtill, unleſs we will deny this great foundation of all our notions, yea and of our Faith alſo, we muſt not give credit to ſo ſtrange and monſtrous a conceit: Yet ſtill we do believe that every duly diſpoſed Communicant doth receive really <hi>the Body and Blood</hi> of Chriſt, in and by theſe Elements, but it is by Faith and not by ſenſe. If we receive them in the manner, and to the end which Chriſt appointed, they give us a lively remembrance of his love and all-ſufficient merit, and thereby invite our Faith to embrace this Crucifyed Redeemer, as the ſatisfaction for our ſins; whereupon he (who is moſt ready to cloſe with
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99778:151"/> penitent Sinners) doth by this rite of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give himſelf and the ſalutary benefits of his Death unto ſuch, and although the manner be myſterious, yet the advantages are real, and the effect more certain than if we eat or drunk his natural fleſh and blood: But we have diverted too far, and therefore will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Meditation upon this part until we come to the Adminiſtration, <hi>Sect.</hi> III. §. 3.</p>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99778:180"/> Feaſt, for it is a <hi>Feaſt upon the Body and blood</hi> of Chriſt, which was the great Sin-offering. Now it was not lawful of old for any<note n="i" place="margin">

It will further appear to be a pledge of Gods infinite love to us, if we conſider, who it is that in this holy Rite he gives to us, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his dearly beloved Son. May we not ſay (as God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.12.)

That which adds weight to all the former is, the conſideration of <hi>the Giver,</hi> who

                        <p n="1">1. Immediately after we return from the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we muſt not entertain any buſineſs or Company, until we have firſt ſeriouſly conſidered the happineſs of our preſent Eſtate, as to the comfort, the hopes, and

                        <p n="2">2. Be ſure immediately to beg of God (as this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition teacheth) the aſſiſtance of his Grace, to which purpoſe the annexed form may be uſed; and to excite our devotion, let us ſadly reflect upon our former backſlidings, and that we have the ſame frail nature<note n="d" place="margin">Multos impedit à fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate praeſumptio fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatis: <hi>Aug. de verb.

As Baptiſm was appointed for the ſame end that Circumciſion was, and did ſucceed in the place thereof, ſo it is moſt reaſonable it ſhould be adminiſtred to the ſame kind of Perſons; and as God commanded Infants to be Circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12. ſo doubtleſs he would have them to be baptized; Nor is it neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould particularly name Children in his Commiſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. it is ſufficient that he did not except them, nor forbid to baptize them; for that ſuppoſeth he intended no alteration in this particular, but that Children ſhould be initiated into the Chriſtian, as well as into the Jewiſh Religion. Beſides, if the Apoſtles had left Children out of the Covenant, and not received them as Members of the Church, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Jews (who took ſuch care to circumciſe them) would have made this a great objection to the Religion, and have been highly ſcandalized thereat. Wherefore ſince Infants are a part of <hi>all Nations,</hi> and we read of whole Houſholds baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.33. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.16. it is highly probable that the Apoſtles themſelves baptized Infants: only the Baptiſm of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men converted from Paganiſm, being more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion, and more illuſtrious, did obſcure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, which being done with leſs ſolemnity, and at the ſame time with the Parents, it ſufficed to note it in general words.

But it is not the giddy attempts of ſuch unſtable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can ſhake this Holy Practice, which is ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo antient, ſo beneficial to the Infants, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the Parents, yea and ſo great a ſecurity to Religion, by binding theſe future hopes of the Church in early Vows of Piety: and that it may be carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and in due time, we ſhall next ſhew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof.</p>

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:99778:213"/> we call upon God by all thoſe Attributes which do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Power and Mercy: we confeſs him to be <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> and <hi>immortal,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>the reliever</hi> of the needy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 69.33. the <hi>helper</hi> of thoſe that fly to his Protection, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. He giveth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life to <hi>Believers,</hi> and raiſeth thoſe that are <hi>Dead, John</hi> 11.25. and therefore he is the fitteſt to be ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in behalf of a weak and helpleſs infant, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Yea we eſteem our ſelves happy that we have ſo great and ſo good a God to come unto in its behalf: for here we do preſent him with an object ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Might and his Mercy; and ſince this poor Creature is ſo miſerable, but yet can neither apprehend its own miſery, nor ſpeak in its own behalf, we our ſelves become its ſpokeſmen, that it may be born again in this Laver of Regeneration, and have all its Sins both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and removed: and doubtleſs ſo Charitable a Prayer from ſo many Hands, preſented to ſuch a God, for ſo deplorable an object, cannot return empty. 2. The next Petition proceeds further, and craves, that when the ſin is removed, and the nature renewed, it may be moſt favourably received by God, and adopted for his own Child. And herein we ſeem to imitate that antient cuſtom preſcribed by the Roman Law, in that kind of Adoption which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Adrogation<note n="r" place="margin">

That the New-birth may be better repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by new and ſpiritual Relations, whence they are termed Godfathers and Godmothers: For God and Nature have ſufficiently obliged the natural Parents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet for the greater care of the baptized's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Church hath added two or three more, that if ſome neglect their Duty, the others may ſupply their defects. Now to theſe Sureties is this plain admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed, as an introduction to the Covenant into which they are about to enter. And firſt it looks back and briefly remembers them what hath been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 1. They have preſented the Child, and in the two firſt Collects begged that God will accept it, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, Sanctifie it, and make it an Heir of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 2. On Gods part they have heard from the mouth of Jeſus, that this Child is capable to receive, and he is willing to give all theſe bleſſings as well unto it, as to thoſe of riper Years, provided the Child be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to perform thoſe conditions, without which God will not grant theſe bleſſings to old nor young. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Therefore this Exhortation looks forwards, and as briefly tells them what it is which the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from them, <hi>viz.</hi> To become Sureties in the name of this Child, and to promiſe to him in its behalf; Firſt
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:99778:218"/> Repentance. Secondly, Faith. Thirdly, Obedience: Let them therefore ſtand forth with ſeriouſneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, remembring they are bound to all theſe things already for themſelves. Yet now God is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them as Bondſmen for a poor helpleſs Soul; in whoſe ſtead they ſtand, and Covenant for it to ſave it from Hell, and to procure it a right to glory: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of which ſtipulation do next follow.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. This great Petition is introduced by remembring a remarkable paſſage in the Paſſion of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the flowing of blood and Water from his holy ſide, as he was hanging on the Croſs, which the Fathers ſay, was from no natural cauſe, but that it was miraculous and a myſtery; deſigned to ſignifie, that as Sin had entred into the World by the Woman (made by a wound in <hi>Adams</hi> ſide) So Salvation came in by the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Water and Blood<note n="i" place="margin">

So that our Church requires it be done by a lawful Miniſter: I know there are ſome allegations out of Antiquity which ſeem to allow of a Lay-Man to Baptize in Caſes of great neceſſity. But there are others of the Fathers who diſallow that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and certainly it is a great preſumption for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon to invade the Miniſterial Office without any Warrant; and as to the pretence that a Child may be in danger, I ſuppoſe the Salvation of the Child may be as ſafe upon the ſtock of Gods mercy without any Baptiſm, as with a Baptiſm that is not commanded by God, nor hath he made any promiſes unto it. So that where God gives not opportunity of a Perſon who may do it aright, it ſeems better to leave it undone. 2. The Words <hi>I Baptize thee, &amp;c.</hi> were always the form of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99778:227"/> the Weſtern Church, and cannot be pronounced Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically by Midwives or ſuch as the Romaniſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit to baptize, but do ſuppoſe a lawful Prieſt, one to whom Chriſt hath given Power to do this: The Eaſtern Church uſe a little variation, <hi>Let N. be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, &amp;c.</hi> but the ſenſe is much the ſame: howſoever in the next words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> all Orthodox Chriſtians ever did agree, becauſe it is of Chriſts own appointment, and unalterable; wherefore when the Hereticks preſumed to vary from this form, they were cenſured by the Church, and thoſe Baptiſms declared null which were not miniſtred in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. I confeſs there were words put in to explain, not to vary the ſenſe<note n="x" place="margin">

Now by Baptizing in the Name of the Three Perſons is not only meant we do it by the Commiſſion and Authority of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; But that we do baptize them into the Faith of the Holy Trinity, and do receive them into that Society of Men who are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Jews and Turks, Heathens, and all falſe Profeſſions in the World, by believing Three Perſons and one God: This is the great fundamental Article on which all the reſt depend, and to which they may be referred; ſo that our very being Baptized into the Trinity, is an Argument we are Chriſtians, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Religion which Jeſus taught. And the more to illuſtrate this, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us, that when Men come to full Age were Baptized, they asked
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99778:227"/> them three ſeveral times, if they did believe in each of the three Perſons, and put them into the Water firſt when they profeſſed their belief in the Father, and again when they declared their Faith in the Son, and a third time when they ſaid they believed in the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Ambroſ. de ſacram. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.

As for the Cuſtom of Dipping or ſprinkling three times, Once at the naming of the Father, again at the naming of the Son, and a third time at the naming of the Holy Ghoſt, it is very likely<note n="a" place="margin">Non ſemel ſed ter, ad ſingula nomina in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonas ſingulas tingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. <hi>Tertul. adverſ.

                           <hi>SEeing now, Dearly Beloved Brethren, that this Child is regenerate,</hi> &amp;c.] We muſt not preſently turn our backs upon God ſo ſoon as the Holy Rite is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but compleat the Solemnity by Thankſgiving and Prayer, and that we may do both, not only with the Spirit, but with Underſtanding, the Miniſter doth here teach us what muſt be the Subjects of our Praiſes
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:99778:232"/> and Petitions. 1. Our Praiſes muſt look back upon the Grace already ſhewed, and the benefits which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given to this Infant, which are principally two. 1. Internally it is regenerated. 2. Externally it is grafted into Chriſts Church; for which we muſt give hearty thanks to Almighty God. To which we muſt add, 2. Our Prayers which muſt look forward upon the grace which will be needful to enable it to live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this Eſtate into which it is admitted; and this we muſt beg of Almighty God alſo, or elſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bleſſings will be altogether in vain. Now all this is ſo plain that no more would need to be added, but only that ſome with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> are apt to ſay, <hi>How can theſe things be? John</hi> 3.9. judging it impoſſible that ſo great a matter as regeneration can be effected ſo ſoon, and by ſo mean an inſtrument<note n="b" place="margin">Simplicitas ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti quibuſdam dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat effectûs fidem, cum ſumptu plurimo &amp; pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, idolorum arcana ſibi authoritatem conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. <hi>Tertul. de Bapt.</hi>

Before this Covenant we were dead in Law, and by the Pardon of our Sins we are begotten again to a lively hope, and herein ſtands the firſt particular of our Regeneration, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, wherefore both Scripture and Antiquity<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 3.3.

But further by Baptiſm we gain new Relations, and old things being done away all things become new. Hence the Jews called their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes New-born Children, becauſe they forſook all their Heathen Kindred; ſo we, although we do not renounce our Earthly Parents becauſe they alſo are Chriſtian, yet we gain new Alliances, for God hereby doth become our Father, and Jeſus our Maſter, and all the Saints both in Heaven and Earth our Brethren, ſo that it is as if we were born over again, ſince Baptiſm doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle us to this Coeleſtial Kindred: But this is not all. For Thirdly, Our corrupt nature is changed in Baptiſm, and there is a renovation effected thereby, both as to the mortification of the old affections, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new, by the Holy Spirit which is hereby given to all that put no bar or impediment unto it.

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99778:234"/> Spirit within them.</hi> And it is manifeſt, that in the firſt Ages of the Church, there was abundance of gifts and graces miraculouſly beſtowed upon Chriſtians in their Baptiſm, and no doubt if the <hi>Catechumens</hi> of our days who are of Age, would prepare themſelves as ſtrictly by Repentance, Faſting, and Prayer, as they of old did, they ſhould find incomparable effects of this ſacred Laver, if not in as miraculous meaſures, yet to as real purpoſes, that is, they ſhould be truly regenerated, and their hearts changed by the influence of the Divine Spirit. But ſome may doubt whether Infants be regenerate in this ſenſe, becauſe they are not capable of giving any Evidences of their receiving the Spirit, nor doth there any immediate effects of their Regeneration appear, hence the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denied it, but they are therefore condemned by the <hi>Milevitan Council Can.</hi> 2. and confuted by St. <hi>Auguſtine ad Bonif. l.</hi> 3.

And if it be asked how it comes to paſs then, that ſo many Children do afterwards fall off to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity?

Now the particulars for which we bleſs our moſt merciful Father, they are Three; all of them acts of free Grace, and effects of a mighty favour, and all of them highly beneficial to the party on whom they are beſtowed. Firſt, That it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to <hi>Regenerate</hi> this Infant with his <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> which is an invaluable mercy: For whereas it was by its firſt Birth guilty of Original Corruption, and lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Eternal Death, in this ſecond Birth that guilt is done away, and that Obligation to Death cancelled, and ſo ſhall ever remain, unleſs it fall under it again by actual diſobedience. And whereas it was defiled and corrupted in the principles of its being deprived of the image of God, under the Power of Sin and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Fleſh, in a ſervile wretched condition, ſo that it could never have pleaſed God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. nor conquer'd its evil affections, nor had it any aſſiſtance or ſtrength ſo to do: But now it is born of the Spirit, and purifyed in the inward Man, and the image of God is begun to be drawn anew, it hath a new principle put into it which will reſiſt the fleſh, and may wholly in time ſubdue it; it is in Covenant with God, and hath promiſes of aid from him, ſo that its nature is healed at
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99778:236"/> preſent, and ſhall be ſanctifyed throughout hereafter, if this Grace be not expelled again: it was an Object of divine wrath, a Veſſel fit for deſtruction, a corrupt abominable Creature; but now it is beloved, purifyed and reſtored, it is admitted to a ſtate of Pardon, put into a Capacity of pleaſing God, and Conquering all its Enemies, and it hath as fair poſſibilities of glory, as the beſt of Gods Saints (which now injoy it) once had. Oh let us bleſs the Almighty for this change, for from ſuch beginnings Eternal felicity uſes to ſpring, and this little ſeed by the divine influence and careful culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, will thrive and grow into a ſtate of perfection and immortality. 2.

Neither we nor the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church do believe them to be ſo regenerate or ſo endued with the Spirit, but that by ſloth and wilful ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity they may be deprived of all again; their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not ſo mortified, but that by complyance and baſe negligence, they may revive again, ſo that the laſt Eſtate ſhall be worſe than the firſt, and it ſhall be more tolerable for Heathens than for vile Apoſtates. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we beg moſt humbly and earneſtly, that this Child may live as one upon whom ſuch great favours are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. The Words of theſe Requeſts are St. <hi>Pauls, Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. and the Phraſe is frequently uſed by the Fathers in this Caſe. The ſum of them is, to deſire that whatſoever is ſhadowed in the Outward part, and ſignified in Rite, may in Subſtance and reality be fulfilled<note n="o" place="margin">Baptiſmus ſalutaris eſt, ſi perfectum eſt in corde quod factum eſt in Corpore. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99778:238"/> and all the deſires of it, but alive unto righteouſneſs, and ready to execute all the commands thereof; That as it is baptized into the Faith of Chriſt Crucified for Sin, ſo it may mortifie and kill all its corrupt affections, until it have utterly aboliſhed all the powers of Luſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and brought the fleſh in ſubjection to the Spirit. We pray that it may not renew the guilt that is remitted, nor fall back into the bondage from which it is delivered, that it may not defile what God hath cleanſed, nor expel what he hath given; but when it comes to underſtanding, that it may make uſe of the Grace that is offered unto it, and improve the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings planted in it, and live like one of Gods Children, and one of the Society of Saints; and then we are aſſured that it ſhall not only have an Intereſt in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſts Death, but feel the power of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and finally, it ſelf alſo ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, of which this Myſtery is a pledge<note n="p" place="margin">Baptiſmus ita<expan>

You God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers have done the Child little kindneſs, if you look after it no further, you have aſſiſted it in vowing and engaging to be the Servant and Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, in abjuring and renouncing all Wickedneſs, and will you not do ſomething to procure it may perform theſe? Be aſſured that Baptiſm will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you nor them good, unleſs it make you more holy afterwards, but will be the aggravation of your Condemnation. Wherefore I will conclude with a threefold Admonition. 1. <hi>To Parents,</hi> who muſt chuſe ſuch Sureties as may be aſſiſtants to them in their weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Charge, and muſt be either ſo pious to bring up their Children well, or ſo humble as to be willing to be told of it by thoſe whom God and the Church hath made their Superviſors. But if Parents be proud and ſcornful, or take ſuch advice in evil part, they are doubtleſs guilty of the breach of this Vow. Secondly, <hi>To Sureties,</hi> Let them not be diſcouraged from this pious underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, by the Duty attending on it, for it is uncharitable to refuſe it, and others have done it for us; we are bound to all theſe things for our ſelves, and every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:99778:241"/> muſt reprove his offending Brother, yet by thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging we become an inſtrument of our Neighbours Salvation, nor ſhall we need to bring any guilt upon our ſelves, for we may eaſily deliver our ſoul; And when we do become Sureties, we may declare to the Parents, that it is our Duty and Reſolution to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Salvation of this Child. Let them take it well or ill, let us not diſpleaſe God and endanger our own Souls<note n="z" place="margin">Amici vitia ſi feras, facis tua. <hi>P. Mim.</hi>

                     <p>THE Concluſion of Baptiſm being an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition that the party Baptized may be brought to Confirmation, would have obliged us to treat of this Rite there; but becauſe the Church hath made it a peculiar Office, we may allow it a peculiar Diſcourſe, and it doth moſt fitly follow that of Baptiſm, being ſo nearly allyed to it, and in purſuance of that great Vow to the obſervance whereof we are all ſo ſtrictly bound: only before we enter upon the Parts of this Office, we ſhall firſt ſurvey the Original thereof.</p>
                     <p>Although our Lord Jeſus did not expreſly inſtitute Confirmation as he did Baptiſm and the Holy Euchariſt, and ſo it is not properly a Sacrament; yet <hi>Aquinas</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies the reaſon why this had no poſitive inſtitution, was, becauſe the Holy-Ghoſt (which is herein to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated) was not given till after Chriſts Aſcenſion, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. yet in his promiſing the Holy Spirit to his Diſciples, <hi>and to remain with his Church for ever, John</hi> 14.16. he ſeemed to ſuppoſe that there ſhould be ſome Rite inſtituted by them for the perpetual Collation of the Spirit. The firſt Converts indeed whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Baptized were confirmed by the immediate Hand of God, and he by miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt ſealed their Baptiſm, and atteſted the Religion into which they had entred: But it was not long before the Apoſtles were appointed to Miniſter in giving the Holy Spirit to the newly Baptized, and then they inſtituted
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:99778:242"/> the Rite of <hi>Laying on of hands:</hi> and God was pleaſed ſo far to approve their inſtitution, that he did actually give wonderful meaſures of the Spirit to thoſe on whom they laid their hands, thereby honouring the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church, and engaging all the Members thereof to be ſubject to them, and to be at Peace one with another: This appears from that famous inſtance, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15, 16, 17. where when the Samaritans had been Converted and Baptized by <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon, they did not receive the Holy Ghoſt, until St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> had Confirmed them<note n="a" place="margin">Id quod deerat à <hi>Petro</hi> &amp; <hi>Johanne</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt, ut oratione pro eis habitâ &amp; manu im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitâ, invocaretur &amp; infunderetur ſuper eos Spiritus Sanctus; Quod nunc quo<expan>

But beſides that we might argue that the Spirit is to abide in the Church for ever, and that Chriſtians have and need it now, though not in ſuch wonderful meaſures, yet as really and effectually to the purpoſes of Sanctification, as any had it then; wherefore there is no reaſon the Rite of Communicating it ſhould ceaſe; beſides this I ſay, we can eaſily Confute this pretence, by ſhewing that the Church did in every Age continue this Cuſtom of Confirming after Baptiſm, which proves they did not imagine it was a Temporary Inſtitution.

And in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth our Church nominate no year, but appointing it be done only to ſuch as are come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and are well inſtructed in the Catechiſm, for how can Children renew their Vow, unleſs they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it is? It was formerly promiſed for them, and now they are to engage, that they will renounce all Evil, believe the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and keep the Commandments of God; wherefore it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that they firſt underſtand the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their Renunciation, the truth of the Creed, the meaning and extent of the ten Commandments, together with the uſe of Prayer and the Sacraments for obtaining Grace to obſerve them, or elſe they can never make a prudent, or a laſting Reſolution; The promiſe was made by others when we were altogether uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but now that God hath ſpared us to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it becomes our own Duty, and we muſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate choice take it upon our ſelves; and as this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face notes, thoſe are the two great ends and benefits of this Duty. 1. That every one may expreſly conſent to the Covenant in which he is ſo highly concerned. 2. That he may before God and many Witneſſes engage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his part thereof.

Conſidering therefore here is ſo great a work to be performed, Miniſters, Parents, and Godfathers muſt moſt diligently prepare thoſe under their Charge for it, and they who are to be Confirmed, muſt examine themſelves if they can freely and willingly make this Vow without any reſerve or hypocriſie, and conſider how they may keep it; and that ſome Days before be ſet apart to this purpoſe is very convenient, for it was an old Order that all ſhould faſt before they came to ſo weighty a Duty. We muſt not dare to come for Company meerly, or for faſhion-ſake, nor let it be ſaid of us as <hi>Sidonius</hi> did of <hi>Theodorich, His worſhip of God is ſuch, that every one might perceive, he ſhewed that obſervance, rather out of Cuſtom, than for any Reverence to Religion,</hi> Sidon. ep. 1. for then we ſhall not only be condemned by Men, but by God alſo.</p>

It was antiently the manner for the Biſhop to lay both his hands a-croſs on the head of the confirmed, not only in imitation of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 48. but with alluſion to the Death of Chriſt in whom we believe, and from whom we receive the Holy Ghoſt. But this is now laid aſide. It may ſeem more ſtrange to ſome, how our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers came to omit the Ceremony of anointing with Oyl, uſed ſo antiently in the Latine Church, and in the Greek alſo, that it hath cauſed the whole Office to be called Chriſm, or Anointing, and by that name it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome very antient Canons: But it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that this Oyl or Chriſm is not of Apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, nor uſe in <hi>Confirmation,</hi> but was added after their times in alluſion to that Oyl unto which the Holy Spirit is compared, for its healing and flaming quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and I am apt to believe this anointing was firſt added to the office of Baptiſm, but not uſed in Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till afterwards, which hath occaſioned divers to miſtake, who apply many places of Antiquity where the Baptiſmal anointing is mentioned, as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Confirmation. However this Chriſmation is accompanied with much ſuperſtition in the Roman Church, and hath excluded the more antient Rite of

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:99778:252"/> ſtretch out <hi>his Hand to Defend us</hi> againſt all our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies. We have given up our ſelves to be his Servants, and <hi>the Hand of the Lord is with us, Luke</hi> 1.66. that is, his Spirit is upon us, and if we keep cloſe to him, <hi>none can pluck us out of his hand, John</hi> 10.28, 29. but we may continue his for ever; <hi>Satan</hi> will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us, the World will allure us, and the Fleſh will entice us, to break this Vow, but the Holy man prays we may be defended by the Spirit of grace, ſo that we may never fall off, as too many have done. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſee ſo many Dedicating themſelves to God, but it is alſo a ſad conſideration, that ſcarce one of twenty remember this engagement, but they firſt forſake God, and then he forſakes them for ever, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. Oh then let us pray, that neither we nor any of our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may prove Apoſtates or Backſliders, but that we may remain under the divine protection, and continue his to our lives end: For if we keep united to this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Root, we ſhall not only live, but flouriſh, grow, and bring forth more and more fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. The Grace now imparted, is of that nature, that if we che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, we ſhall <hi>encreaſe</hi> daily therein, and therefore the Biſhop prays we may not only have the Spirit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but that we may grow in Grace every Day, even until we be fitted for glory, and <hi>be partakers of Gods Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſpeaks.

For who doth now expect that thoſe on whom hands are laid, for receiving the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould preſently begin to ſpeak with tongues? but yet the divine Love is underſtood to be ſecretly and inviſibly inſpired into their hearts by the Bond of Peace which enables them to ſay, The love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which he hath given us.

                     <p>Thus we have repreſented a Rite in it ſelf Primitive and Pious, in its Adminiſtration pure and ſeparate from all that Superſtition had added to it, in its End ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it is commended by Chriſtians of all perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and yet alas (however it comes to paſs) too much neglected, to the grief of all good Men, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the Church, and the great detriment of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore we cannot leave it till we have preſſed the conſtant obſervation thereof. The Romaniſts indeed pretend to prefer it before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm<note n="b" place="margin">

It is not in our Church ſet to vye with Baptiſm, but as of old appointed to purſue the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and ordered to make the Baptiſmal Vow more ſolemn, and more regarded. We do not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny Salvation to all that want it, but we judge it a great ſin to deſpiſe it, or wilfully to neglect it; And we think it highly concerns the Church and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon to be careful it be not omitted, and that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:99778:254"/> for theſe Reaſons: I. Becauſe it tends very much to advance the knowledge of Chriſtian People, who are more obliged to teach and to learn, when ſo ſolemn an Account is to be given. II. It conduceth to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Piety alſo, and lays freſh engagements upon every one to avoid Evil and to do good, obtaining withal the Spirit for their aſſiſtance therein. III. It is an excellent means to preſerve the Churches Peace, and may prevent many from falling into Schiſm and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by laying a good foundation at firſt, and by reſcuing the younger from the dire misfortune of Evil guides. IV. It doth effectually confute the clamours of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts againſt our cuſtom of baptizing Children before they can underſtand; for if this be added, we have the benefit of Baptiſm againſt the danger of Death, and yet the ſame ſecurity they pretend to who defer it till riper years. V. Hereby we ſhall agree with the Apoſtles, with the Catholick Church in all Ages, with all thoſe wiſe and holy Men who have enjoined and practiſed this Rite, and believed great benefits were received thereby: Which Conſiderations I hope will have their due effect upon all that are concerned. And I. That the Reverend Fathers of the Church will imitate the Piety of the Primitive Biſhops, and not eſteem it a trouble to go into the Country to confirm<note n="c" place="margin">Non quidem abnuo hanc eſſe Eccleſiarum conſuetudinem, ut ad eos qui longe in minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus urbibus per Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros &amp; Diaconos bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zati ſunt, Epiſcopus ad invocationem Sancti Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritûs manum impoſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus excurrat. <hi>Hieron.</hi>
                        </note>, ſince they will thereby bring ſo much good to the Church, &amp; beget in the minds of the People a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affection to their Perſons, and a great Veneration of their Office. II. That Parents and Godfathers who ſtand obliged by the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Vow, will be careful to obtain a diſcharge from the Bonds they have entred, and when they have done their Duty in
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:99778:255"/> fitting their Charge for Confirmation, I hope they will not repine at a little trouble and charge, but rather go to the Biſhop, than want ſo great a benefit to themſelves and to the Child. III. I hope that Miniſters will be ready to promote it, conſidering that when they have fitted their Catechumens for this Office, and brought them to it, they are excellently prepared to receive the benefit of all their after labours, and may well hope to give a good account to God of them. Finally, I wiſh this ſerious Advice may encourage all perſons who want Confirmation, of what Age or condition ſoever, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and wait for an opportunity of it, and that it may direct thoſe who come to it to perform their part acceptably, and ſo as to gain the benefits of it. And alſo that it may warn all who have been Confirmed, <hi>To keep the grace thereof</hi> (as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>intire and without ſpot in their heart, daily encreaſing in good works, and walking in all well-pleaſing to the Author of their Salvation Chriſt Jeſus, to whom be glory for ever and ever</hi>
